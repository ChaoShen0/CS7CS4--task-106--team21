# Group Assignment of TCD CS7CS4 (Machine Learning) module. Team 21, Task Question ID: 106
This is the github repository for the group assignment of Module CS7CS4 (Machine Learning) of Trinity College Dublin. 
Our team number is 21, task question is No.106, "Hyper-Parameter Tuning: How strong is the impact on ML performance?"
## Task question details: 
### Hyper-Parameter Tuning: How strong is the impact on ML performance?
 Machine learning algorithms have hyper parameters than cannot be learned and that need to be optimized (e.g. “k” in k-nearest   neighbour). 
 How strong is the impact of optimizing hyper parameter? 
 In other words, how much better do optimized algorithms perform compared to algorithms for which hyperparameters were not optimized? 
 Or, how effective are different optimization strategies?
